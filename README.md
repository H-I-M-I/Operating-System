# Operating-System
This repository contains code implementations for various concepts in operating systems. The following topics are covered:

### Included Codes:
- **Deadlock**: Implementation of deadlock detection and avoidance techniques.
- **Page Replacement**: 
  - **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: A simple page replacement algorithm that replaces the oldest page.
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: An algorithm that replaces the least recently used page.
- **Paging**: Simulation of the paging mechanism for memory management.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms, including:
  - **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**
  - **Non-Preemptive Priority (P_NP)**
  - **Preemptive Priority (P_P)**
  - **Round Robin (RR)**
  - **Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF_NP)**
  - **Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF_P)**
- **Segmentation**: Code demonstrating memory segmentation and its management.
